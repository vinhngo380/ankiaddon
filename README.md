# ankiaddon
An addon on the SRS software Anki that would allow the user to see multiple retention rates (unique passed/(unique passed + unique failed)) on each day across a span of time.
I think it's useful to see this if you want to know what settings/methods work for you, as well as to see your progress.
It will only initially have values listed, but I hope to try to make this into something more graphical that is easy to read, similar to how Anki does its statistics in the statistics tab.
